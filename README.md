# Signature Preservation

Have you ever been annoyed when you're in the middle of a battle, you're so close to getting your Ultimate Q ability charged, but you have to back off just to grab a potion... but you know, when you come back to your sword, the ability meter will have reset?

Boy do I have the mod for you! It's simple: when you unequip your weapon to use something else in your hotbar, our patented Signature Preservation system engages and saves your current charge level directly in memory, and when you swap back, it restores it!

This works for all weapons with a charge (yes, even the unreleased ones in creative mode!), and it works as long as the weapon stays in the same slot (the charge dissipates if you log off, move the weapon to a different slot, inventory, chest, backpack, your cat's litter or your momma's favorite teacup).

There's no configuration, no setting, no UI, just install the mod and GO! It works in multiplayer AND singleplayer of course.

This is my first mod, so... how did I do? Let me know, I'm happy to get your feedback!
